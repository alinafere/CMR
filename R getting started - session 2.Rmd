## Today's lecture

- Customizing ggplot2 graphics
- Data manipulations using dplyr

# Recap

## Documents and software

Have the **latest version** of:

- R: [https://CRAN.R-project.org](https://CRAN.R-project.org)
- RStudio Desktop: [https://www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com)

- Installation instructions on Canvas


## Software requirements

Package tidyverse (for ggplot2 and dplyr), and haven:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("haven")
```

Optionally, also colourpicker and ggthemes:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library("colourpicker")
library("ggthemes")
```

Data sets:
- Prestige.RData: Prestige of occupations in Canada
- vwgolf.RData: Dutch ads of second-hand 2009 Volkswagen Golfs

## An R session

- Create a new script file: File -> New file -> R Script

- Save script file: Keyboard shortcut: *Ctrl / Cmd + S*

- Do not store the objects (workspace) you created

- Execute the line in which your cursor is with Ctrl / Cmd + Enter 

## Loading data

File --> Open File ... and select the R data file in the dialog

Path relative to the current working directory:

If the file is not in the working directory, specify the full path:

``` {r}
load("~/Documents/CMR/session_1/Prestige.RData")
```
 
---> No need for full path if file is in the working directory

Always use / and not \\ (Windows!)

## Basic plotting with package ggplot2

Add together two basic elements:

1. Scaffolding deffned by ggplot()

    - Selects the data set
    
    - Defines the variables to be used (the aesthetic mapping): function aes()

2. Any number of visual representations of the data, known as geoms

    - Define the visual representation (the geometric objects): function family geom\_x()
    
    - Different elements are added to the plot using the + operator
    
Load the package:

```{r,  fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
library("ggplot2")
```

## Scatterplot: Scaffolding

```{r,  fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(Prestige, aes(x = prestige, y = logincome))
```

## Scatterplot: Scaffolding + points

```{r,  fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(Prestige, aes(x = prestige, y = logincome)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Histogram

```{r,  fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(Prestige, aes(x = prestige)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## Density plot

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(Prestige, aes(x = prestige)) +
  geom_density()
```

## Conditional boxplot

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(Prestige, aes(x = type, y = prestige)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## Barplot

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(Prestige, aes(x = type)) + geom_bar()
```

## Some geoms
For a complete list of geoms, [click here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/). Important ones include:

geom\_point(): Points

geom\_line(): Lines / time series

geom\_[h/v]line(): Horizontal or vertical line

geom\_bar() Bars

geom\_boxplot() Box and whiskers plot

geom\_density() Density estimate

geom\_smooth() Fitted regression line

geom\_[text/label]() Text

geom\_tile() Rectangles for heat maps

--> Use appropriate geoms!

# Customizing ggplot2 Graphics

## VW Golf data

Load the data set:

```{r}
load("~/Documents/CMR/session_2/vwgolf.RData")
```

View the data in RStudio:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(vwgolf)
```

Print the dimensions:

```{r, eval=F}
dim(vwgolf)
```

Univariate summary statistics:

```{r, eval=F}
summary(vwgolf)
```


## Exercise 1

Create a new R script, and do the following:

1. Create a scatterplot of Mileage against AskingPrice

2. Create a scatterplot of Mileage against PriceNew minus AskingPrice

3. Create a histogram and density plot of Mileage

4. Create boxplots of Mileage conditional on Fuel

## Scatterplot
```{r,  , fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
 ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice)) + geom_point()
```


## Adding multiple geoms

Multiple layers can be added to a plot, such as a regression line:

```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
 ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Arguments for Fine-tuning
Finetuning can be done for:

**colour** Colour for points/lines (alternatively, color)

**fill** Fill colour for areas

**alpha** Transparency of colours

**shape** Symbol for points

**linetype** Type of line

**size** Size of points/lines

If same setting should be used for all points/lines/areas:

---> Best to supply those arguments to geom\_ xxx()

## Scatterplot with Colour

```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice)) +
geom_point(colour = "red")
```

## Colors 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
colours()
```

## Colour Picker
Package colourpicker contains a nice Colour Picker, which will appear in
RStudio under Addins after installation:

![Colorpicker](~/Documents/CMR/colorPicker.png)

## Scatterplot with Colour

```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice)) +
geom_point(colour = "#00CED1")
```

## Kernel Density Plot with Colour

```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = AskingPrice)) +
geom_density(fill = "orangered2")
```


## Plot Symbols

![Symbols](~/Documents/CMR/session_2/points.png){width=50%}

--->Specify fill colour for symbols 21---25 with parameter fill


## Adjusted Scatterplot

```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice)) +
  geom_point(colour = "black", fill = "chartreuse3", shape = 21,
             size = 3)
```

## Linetypes

![Symbols](~/Documents/CMR/session_2/linetypes.png){width=50%}

---> Specify line type by index or character string


## Kernel Density Plot: Linetype

```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = AskingPrice)) +
geom_density(fill = "grey", linetype = 5, colour = "red")
```

## Exercise 2
Adjust your plots from the previous exercises as indicated:

1. Create a scatterplot of Mileage against AskingPrice

      - Increase the point size to 3. Set the plotting symbol to 22. Use a purple colour for filling the symbols.

2. Create a histogram of Mileage

    - Change the type of line to dashed, and the colour of the line to red.

    - Also change the fill colour to red. Set the fill colour to be partly transparent using alpha = 0.5.

## Mapping Parameters to Aesthetics

Mapping graphical parameters to variables adds more information to a plot
Colour / shape / etc. can be mapped to depend on the value of a
variable

Specify such mappings in the aesthetic mapping in aes()

The scale xxx() functions determine how different colours / shapes
/ etc. are assigned

---> Powerful, but don't add too much information

## Scatterplot: Colour Mapping

```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice, fill = Fuel)) +
geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3)
```

## Scatterplot: Size Mapping

```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, 
       aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice, size = TopSpeed)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = "turquoise3")
```


## Scatterplot: Colour Mapping
```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, 
       aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice, colour = NrOwners)) +
  geom_point(size = 4)
```

## Scatterplot: Colour and Size Mappings
```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice,
colour = NrOwners, size = TopSpeed)) +
geom_point()
```

## Kernel Density Plot: Fill
```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = Mileage, fill = Fuel)) +
geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

## Exercise 3

1. Plot PriceNew against AskingPrice using a scatterplot. Let the size of the points depend on TopSpeed. Use shape 21, and let the fill colour depend on Mileage.

2. Create a conditional boxplot of PriceNew conditional on Colour.
Map the fill colour of the boxes to Colour.

## Custom Scales

---> Built-in scales are used to obtain default values

Custom discrete scales supplied through function family scale xxx manual():

scale\_colour\_manual() - Colour for points/lines

scale\_fill\_manual() - Fill colour for areas

scale\_alpha\_manual() - Transparency of colours

scale\_shape\_manual() - Symbol for points

scale\_linetype\_manual() - Type of line

scale\_size\_manual() - Size of points/lines

---> Custom values are supplied via argument values

---> Scales are added to a plot with the + operator

## Scatterplot: Manual Shapes
```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice, shape = Fuel)) +
geom_point(size = 4) + scale_shape_manual(values = c("B", "D"))
```

## Removing Legends
For some plots, the legend might not provide new information:

---> Can be removed by setting the argument show.legend to FALSE in
the geom


## Scatterplot: Manual Shapes
```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
 ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice, shape = Fuel)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("B", "D"))
```

## Scatterplot: Manual Colours
```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, 
       aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice, colour = Imported))+
  geom_point() + 
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#1333E6", "#EB934C"))
```


## Continuous Colour Scales
For scales based on continuous variables:

Sequential colour scales are more appropriate

For example, scale\_colour\_gradient() from dark to light

## Scatterplot: Manual Colours
```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
 ggplot(vwgolf, 
        aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice, fill = NrOwners))+
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "blue")
```

## Picking Colours
Some colours are better at conveying the information than others

---> Choose carefully, e.g., using packages such as colorspace, or the
ggplot2 defaults

---> Never use red and green together

## Exercise 4

1. Create a scatterplot of PriceNew against AskingPrice. Let the
point size depend on TopSpeed and the colour depend on Mileage. Use shape 21 with a fill.

2. Change the scale of the fill colour to range from white to red. Store
the plot as an object named price plot.

3. Why are there grey dots in the plot?

## Facets

facet grid() constructs multiple panels or facets:

```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice)) +
  geom_point() + facet_grid(Class ~ Colour)
```

## You can use single or multiple variables to define the facets

```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5}
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice)) +
geom_point() + facet_grid(Class ~ .)
```

## More Options
Axis limits:

Use lims() with arguments x and y

Titles, subtitles, and axis titles:

Use labs() with the arguments title, subtitle, x or y

Switch horizontal and vertical axes:

Use coord flip()

Fix the aspect ratio:

Use coord fixed() (Important for representing distances)

---> Simply add to plot object with the + operator

## Exercise 5

1. Add an appropriate title and subtitle to your price plot from
Exercise 4.

2. Add neater axis labels.

3. Use an aspect ratio of one.

## Themes
The theme() function gives control over other aspects of the plot:

---> See ?theme for an extensive list of options

---> Setting these options makes use of the element xxx() functions (such as element blank())

You can:

Use the default theme, or

Tweak aspects of the plot to taste, or

Use a built-in theme function, such as theme bw() or theme classic(), or

Even develop your own theme function.

## Printer-friendly theme
```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5.5} 
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = Mileage, fill = Fuel)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + theme_bw()
``` 

## Additional themes
Packages like ggthemes provide additional themes and colour schemes:

```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5} 
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = Mileage, fill = Fuel)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + theme_economist() +
  scale_fill_economist()
```

## Wall Street Journal theme and colours:
```{r,   fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 4.5} 
ggplot(vwgolf, aes(x = PriceNew, y = AskingPrice, colour = Fuel)) +
geom_point() + theme_wsj() + scale_colour_wsj()
```


## Aside: Embedding R graphics in documents

1. In the Plots tab of the lower right panel, click Export ---> Copy to Clipboard...

2. In the dialog, change width and height if necessary and click *Copy Plot*

3. In the document, paste the plot from clipboard

# Data Manipulation with dplyr

## dplyr functions

What to do if the data is not exactly in the form you want?

The dplyr package makes it easy to:

- Pick observations by value with filter()

- Reorder the rows using arrange()

- Pick variables by name using select()

- Create new variables from existing ones using mutate()

- Collapse many values to a summary statistic using summarize()

## Philosophy

filter(), arrange(), select(), mutate() and summarize() all work
similarly:

1. First argument is a data frame

2. Subsequent arguments tell R what to do with the data

3. The result is a modified data frame

---> All of these can do group-specific computations using group\_by()


## Subsets of observations

---> Function filter() finds observations where a specified condition is
true and drops all other observations

Keep only the stationwagons
```{r, eval=F}
filter(vwgolf, Class == "Stationwagon")
```

Keep only the black cars
```{r, eval=F}
filter(vwgolf, Colour == "Black")
```

Keep only the black stationwagons
```{r, eval=F}
filter(vwgolf, Colour == "Black", Class == "Stationwagon")
```

## Comparisons

Operator/ function **Operation** Example

== **exactly equal** x == y

!= **not equal** x != y

<= **less or equal** x <= y

\>= **greater or equal** x \>= y

\< **less** x < y

\> **greater** x > y

is.na() **is missing** is.na(x)

## Basic logic
Operator/ function **Operation** Example

! **not** !is.na(x)

& **and** (x > 0) & (x < 1)

\| **or** (x < 0) | (x > 1)


## More filtering rows
Keep only cars with Mileage at most 50 000 km

```{r, eval=F}
filter(vwgolf, Mileage <= 50000)
```

---> Note that missing values (NA) are excluded

Display cars with missing values on Mileage:
```{r, eval=F}
filter(vwgolf, is.na(Mileage))
```

Display cars with Mileage at most 50 000 km, or with Mileage missing:
```{r, eval=F}
filter(vwgolf, Mileage <= 50000 | is.na(Mileage))
```


## Selecting subsets of variables

---> Function select() keeps the specified variables (in that order)

Example: Drop all variables after Fuel

These are all equivalent:
```{r, eval=F}
vw_num <- select(vwgolf, Version, Class, Transmission, Fuel)
vw_num <- select(vwgolf, Version:Fuel)
vw_num <- select(vwgolf, -(Colour:DaysAPK))
head(vw_num)
```

## Rearranging columns, selection based on names

Put AskingPrice and PriceNew first, then everything() else:

```{r, eval=F}
select(vwgolf, AskingPrice, PriceNew, everything())
```

Select variables with names starting with "Weight"

```{r, eval=F}
select(vwgolf, starts_with("Weight"))
```

---> Also ends with(), contains(), matches() etc. (see ?starts\_with)

## Sorting rows with arrange()
---> Rows can be sorted based on one or more variables using arrange()

Sort by AskingPrice:
```{r, eval=F}
arrange(vwgolf, AskingPrice)
```
---> By default, sorted in ascending order

Use desc() to get descending order:

```{r, eval=F}
arrange(vwgolf, desc(AskingPrice))
```

Using multiple variables:

```{r, eval=F}
arrange(vwgolf, Fuel, desc(AskingPrice))
```

## Adding or modifying columns
---> Add new or modify existing columns using mutate()
Add difference between AskingPrice and PriceNew:


```{r, eval=F}
mutate(vwgolf, PriceDifference = PriceNew - AskingPrice)
```

Transform Mileage to be in 1000's of kilometres:

```{r, eval=F}
mutate(vwgolf, Mileage = Mileage / 1000)
```

You can do multiple mutations at once:

```{r, eval=F}
mutate(vwgolf, PriceDifference = PriceNew - AskingPrice,
Mileage = Mileage / 1000)
```

## Summarise
---> Use summarize() to collapse many variables into summary statistics

Specify a name for the summary statistic, and an expression giving the value:

```{r, eval=F} 
summarize(vwgolf,
NumberOfCars = length(AskingPrice),
MeanPrice = mean(AskingPrice),
MinPrice = min(AskingPrice),
MaxPrice = max(AskingPrice),
SDPrice = sd(AskingPrice))
```

## Conditional computations
---> Use function group\_by() to make all subsequent computations conditional on one or more grouping variables

---> Use ungroup() to undo the grouping behaviour

Summarize AskingPrice per level of Colour:

```{r, eval=F} 
summarize(group_by(vwgolf, Colour),
NumberOfCars = length(AskingPrice),
MeanPrice = mean(AskingPrice),
MinPrice = min(AskingPrice),
MaxPrice = max(AskingPrice),
SDPrice = sd(AskingPrice))
```


## Putting it all together

---> The power of dplyr comes from combining multiple operations in
succession

1. Retain only diesel cars

2. Then select only some variables of interest

3. Add a new variable called PriceDifference

4. Then summarize by PriceDifference and Mileage

## In one expression:
```{r, eval=F} 
summarize(
  group_by(
    mutate(
      select(
        filter(vwgolf, Fuel == "Diesel"),
        AskingPrice, PriceNew, Mileage, Colour
        ),
      PriceDifference = PriceNew - AskingPrice
      ),
    Colour
    ),
  MeanPriceDifference = mean(PriceDifference),
  MeanMileage = mean(Mileage)
)
```

---> Alternative 1: Store result from intermediate steps

---> Alternative 2: Use the pipe operator %>% to chain the commands from left to right

## Chaining with pipes

The function call
```{r, eval=F} 
f(x, y)
```

is the same as

```{r, eval=F} 
x %>% f(y)
```


--->Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + M in RStudio inserts a pipe operator


## Piped data manipulation pipeline
Example revisited:

```{r, eval=F}
vwgolf %>%
filter(Fuel == "Diesel") %>%
select(AskingPrice, PriceNew, Mileage, Colour) %>%
mutate(PriceDifference = PriceNew - AskingPrice) %>%
group_by(Colour) %>%
summarize(MeanPriceDifference = mean(PriceDifference),
MeanMileage = mean(Mileage))
```


## Store the final results for reuse if needed:
```{r, eval=F}
vwgolf_summary <- vwgolf %>%
filter(Fuel == "Diesel") %>%
select(AskingPrice, PriceNew, Mileage, Colour) %>%
mutate(PriceDifference = PriceNew - AskingPrice) %>%
group_by(Colour) %>%
summarize(MeanPriceDifference = mean(PriceDifference),
MeanMileage = mean(Mileage))
```
